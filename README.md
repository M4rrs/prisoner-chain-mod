# Minecraft Prisoner Chain Mod

First of all, there are plenty of leash mods that work on all mobs, but most of them are not (yet) compatible with the current Minecraft version 1.19.4. So I decided to take matters into my own hands lmao.

Second, I have zero Java coding experience. None. And I see a lot of modding advice that tell people to at least know some Java, but I don't. However I am a student of the 42Network, I'm sure I can learn this along the way. :thumbsup:

With that in mind, I cannot guarantee that any of the code will be the most optimised. Nor do I even know if I will actually succeed in creating this mod.

The purpose of this mod is to fulfill my evil minecraft desires. That is all I will say.

The Fabric mod template I used can be found [here](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric-example-mod)
